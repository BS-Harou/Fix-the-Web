#Repository of the "Fix the Web" Opera extension

"Fix the Web" is an upcoming extension for [Opera Web Browser](http://www.opera.com/browser). Many web pages use malformed HTML, poorly-written Javascript, or bad web development practices such as browser-sniffing. Consequently, these pages could produce visual flaws, functional glitches, or even worse, be completely nonfunctional in Opera, a standards-conforming web browser. 

The goal of *Fix the Web* is to provide a solution to these problems by allowing users to report site problems they encounter, reply to others' bug reports, and, most importantly, apply patches to broken web pages.

This project is open source, so your contributions will help it grow. Fork the project and contribute!

If you want to apply a patch to a web page, then then you are looking for the [patches script repository](https://github.com/cyberstream/Fix-the-Web-Patch-Script)
