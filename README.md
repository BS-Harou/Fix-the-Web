#Repository of the "Fix the Web" Opera extension

#What is Fix the Web?
"Fix the Web" is an upcoming extension for [Opera Web Browser](http://www.opera.com/browser). Many web pages use malformed HTML, poorly-written Javascript, or bad web development practices such as browser-sniffing. Consequently, these pages could produce visual flaws, functional glitches, or even worse, be completely nonfunctional in Opera, a standards-conforming web browser. 

#What is purpose of this extension?
The goal of *Fix the Web* is to provide a solution to these problems by allowing users to report site problems they encounter, reply to others' bug reports, and, most importantly, apply patches to broken web pages.

#Applying patches and road-map
If you want to apply a patch to a web page, then then you are looking for the patches.js and [CSS patches](http://github.com/cyberstream/Fix-the-Web-CSS-Patches).

When you're making JS based patches, then you have to make this patch in extension. There's a file in **includes** folder as patches.js. More information is in [here](http://my.opera.com/fix-the-web/blog/2012/03/01/how-to-patch-a-web-page)

You can see the long-term plan for the extension [here.](http://my.opera.com/community/forums/findpost.pl?id=11505222)
